This must have happened thousands of times, and I got access to this information without paying a single dime out of my pocket. After being pushed forward countless times by strangers on the internet to become the software engineer I am today, it only feels right to pay it forward to the next person who aspires to build.

I have learned a ton of specific knowledge as a software engineer so far, and I hope to ingrain that knowledge in this blog. In the best case, the specific knowledge in this blog will provide value to at least one other person. In the worst case, this blog will establish additional credibility for me as an engineer.

We stand on the shoulders of giants. Everyone’s accomplishments, both individually and as a whole, are built on the works of our predecessors and the guidance of our role models. Just like Aang from Avatar: The Last Airbender needed the help of previous avatars to save the world, we need role models to help us persevere and most importantly — to believe in us. If anyone is an aspiring software engineer and is struggling to find software engineering job, feel free to reach out to me anytime. My twitter DMs are open @visaals. I’ve been through the job hunting process and can confirm it sucks. The unfortunate reality is that software engineering skills do not cleanly translate to demonstrating software engineering skills in while interviewing. I have spent considerable amount of time and energy curating the content I found most helpful, persevering through failed interviews, and ultimately getting five New Grad SWE job offers ranging from $70k to $150k annually.

The point is that you don’t have to be an expert at something to be qualified to teach something. You don’t need a PhD in math to teach fractions to 4th graders. With that in mind, I’m going to start off by writing about the practical things I’ve done (so far): Step-by-step: How To Double Your $70k SWE Salary Learn the System, Game the System: how to use the internet to achieve practically anything you want (a meta version of #1, going beyond the common “just google it” advice) And the stuff I’m currently learning: How to Quickly Understand a Giant Codebase (currently learning) SWE’s Guide to Efficient Note Taking The Most Frustrating Bugs I’ve Come Across And How To Avoid Them, a recurring series And general interesting thoughts and ideas I have and come across: How The Internet is The Greatest Equalizer in History Life as Series of Games And more, coming soon to an inbox near you!
